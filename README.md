## üöÄ Quick Start

To quickly get started with IntelliFold, you can use the following commands:
```bash
# Install intellifold from PyPI
pip install intellifold
# Run inference with an example YAML file
intellifold predict ./examples/5S8I_A.yaml --out_dir ./output
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To more complete installation instructions and usage, please refer to the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).


## üîç Inference

1. **Prepare Input File**: Create a YAML file with your sequences following our [input format specification](docs/input_yaml_format.md)

2. **Run Prediction**:
   ```bash
   intellifold predict your_input.yaml --out_dir ./results
   ```

3. **Check Results**: Find predicted structures and confidence scores in the output directory, you can also check the section of **output format** in [output documentation](docs/input_yaml_format.md#output-format).

4. **Optional Optimization**: Enable [custom kernels](docs/kernels.md) for faster inference and reduced memory usage

5. **Custom MSA Servers**: For enterprise or private deployments requiring authentication, see the [MSA Server Authentication](docs/usage.md#msa-server-authentication) section in our usage guide.

For comprehensive usage instructions and examples, refer to the [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md).


## üìä Benchmarking
To comprehensively evaluate the performance of IntelliFold, we conducted a rigorous evaluation on [FoldBench](https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/FoldBench). We compared IntelliFold against several leading methods, including [Boltz-1,2](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz), [Chai-1](https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab), [Protenix](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix) and [Alphafold3](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3).

For more details on the benchmarking process and results, please refer to our [Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02025).

## üåê IntelliFold Server

**We highly recommend using the [IntelliFold Server](https://server.intfold.com) for the most accurate, complete, and convenient biomolecular structure predictions.** It requires no installation and provides an intuitive web interface to submit your sequences and visualize results directly in your browser. The server runs the **full, optimized, latest** IntelliFold implementation for optimal performance.

- The implementation of **fast layernorm operators** is inspired by [OneFlow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow) and [FastFold](https://github.com/hpcaitech/FastFold), following [Protenix](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix)'s usage. 
- Many components in `intellifold/openfold/` are adapted from [OpenFold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold), with substantial modifications and improvements by our team (except for the `LayerNorm` part).  
- This repository, the implementation of **Inference Data Pipeline**(Data/Feature Processing and MSA generation tasks) referred to [Boltz-1](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz), and modify some codes to adapt to the input of our model.
